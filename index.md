### System Development 
We all know that creating systems can increase our “productivity” but there are so many different tools out there and most take time to set up, deploy, and maintain. 

My key for system development is utilizing the tools you already use by building personalized systems of organization, management, and communication. 

### Story boarding
Talk through your ideas and get help prioritizing. My key for story boarding is just listening and giving input when needed, because the one with the vision knows where they’re headed. I can take all the ideas and put forth a plan.

I edit videos, audio, and create images or animations for content.
